# 🧠 GNN-Based Community & Polarization Detector

This interactive Streamlit app uses **Graph Neural Networks (GCNs)** and **unsupervised clustering** to analyze how communities form and interact in social networks. 
It visualizes hidden patterns, detects polarization, and identifies influential nodes using PageRank and community structures.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Upload and analyze various network datasets (Athletes, Government, Public Figures, etc.)
- 📊 Visualize learned GCN embeddings in 2D with UMAP
- 🌐 Explore network structure with Pyvis (interactive force-directed graph)
- 🧮 Compute and display polarization score based on community edges
- 🔦 Search and highlight individual nodes to reveal metadata
- 📈 View cluster size summaries and export results as CSV
